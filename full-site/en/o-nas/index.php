                The New York Concept House Residential Estate is located in the very heart of Kiev – it is a project of a business class residential estate implemented in the capital of Ukraine. The concept of the house is borrowed from New York which could be seen in the non-standard, large windows and floor height differences. The New York Concept House Residential Estate is a prestigious complex that is not only named after the famous capital of the world, but also repeats its uniqueness. The straight lines of the façade with warm colours and consistent style of New York – all these features help it to perfectly fit into the existing development of the area and offer its residents comfortable and versatile apartment layouts.

                <h2 class="h4">The history of the idea</h2>
                <p>
                This extraordinary project was created by two residents of Kiev having emigrated to the USA as a child. After returning home, they decided to implement their dream of an ideal place to live in the Ukrainian capital. Architects and designers of the New York Concept House Residential Estate spent long time studying the details of design and construction of accommodation in New York, so as to implement a similar experience in Kiev. We can safely say that the project being implemented is well-thought to the smallest detail, and the quality of the work is impeccable.
